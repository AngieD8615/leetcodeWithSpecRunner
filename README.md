# Coding challenges
Hello GitHub Family,
I have been doing a lot of toy problems to practice algorithm problems.
Now I am looking to expand some of my thinking into testing. In this repo
you will find a bunch of algorithm and data structure problems that I have
encountered. And a handful of tests to go with each. 

### Tech
JavaScript, Mocha, Chai 

### Toy Problems
Many (if not all) of these problems are from leetcode.com

### Set-up 
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. In the root directory run `npm install`
3. Drag and drop the `specRunner.html` into your browser

### Create your own repo
Make a new root directory on your computer, `cd` into the directory
Initialize node package manager: `npm init`
Install mocha and chiai (run in the browser): `npm install mocha chai --save-dev`
Make a new directory called spec. This will house your tests
Make a new directory called src. This will house your source code
Create a `README.md` file
Copy my `specRunner.html` file. Change the scripts to match your repo.
  <!-- load code you want to test here -->
  <script src="src/leetcodeEasy.js"></script>
  <!-- load your test files here -->
  <script src="spec/spec1.js"></script>
Have fun with it!!
